# Defining _R1_ and _R2_

Most of the stemmers make use of at least one of the region definitions _R1_ and _R2_ They are defined as follows:

_R1_ is the region after the first non-vowel following a vowel, or is the null region at the end of the word if there is no such non-vowel.

_R2_ is the region after the first non-vowel following a vowel in _R1_, or is the null region at the end of the word if there is no such non-vowel.

The definition of _vowel_ varies from language to language. In French, for example, **_Ã©_** is a vowel, and in Italian **_i_** between two other vowels is not a vowel. The class of letters that constitute vowels is made clear in each stemmer.

Below, _R1_ and _R2_ are shown for a number of English words,

    b   e   a   u   t   i   f   u   l
                      |<------------->|    R1
                              |<----->|    R2

Letter **_t_** is the first non-vowel following a vowel in _beautiful_, so _R1_ is **_iful_**. In **_iful_**, the letter **_f_** is the first non-vowel following a vowel, so _R2_ is **_ul_**.

    b   e   a   u   t   y
                      |<->|    R1
                        ->|<-  R2

In _beauty_, the last letter **_y_** is classed as a vowel. Again, letter **_t_** is the first non-vowel following a vowel, so _R1_ is just the last letter, **_y_**. _R1_ contains no non-vowel, so _R2_ is the null region at the end of the word.

    b   e   a   u
                ->|<-  R1
                ->|<-  R2

In _beau_, _R1_ and _R2_ are both null.
