# Danish stemming algorithm

## The stemming algorithm

The Danish alphabet includes the following additional letters,

**_æ å ø_**

The following letters are vowels:

**_a e i o u y æ å ø_**

A consonant is defined as a character from ASCII a-z which isn't a vowel (originally this was "A consonant is defined as a non-vowel" but since 2018-11-15 we've changed this definition to avoid the stemmer altering alphanumeric codes which end with a repeated digit).

_R2_ is not used: _R1_ is defined in the same way as in the [German stemmer](german.qmd). (See the [note](r1r2.qmd) on _R1_ and _R2_.)

Define a valid **_s_**\-ending as one of

**_a &nbsp; b &nbsp; c &nbsp; d &nbsp; f &nbsp; g &nbsp; h &nbsp; j &nbsp; k &nbsp; l &nbsp; m &nbsp; n &nbsp; o &nbsp; p &nbsp; r &nbsp; t &nbsp; v &nbsp; y &nbsp; z &nbsp; å_**

Do each of steps 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Step 1:

Search for the longest among the following suffixes in _R1_, and perform the action indicated.

(_a_) **_hed &nbsp; ethed &nbsp; ered &nbsp; e &nbsp; erede &nbsp; ende &nbsp; erende &nbsp; ene &nbsp; erne &nbsp; ere &nbsp; en &nbsp; heden &nbsp; eren &nbsp; er &nbsp; heder &nbsp; erer &nbsp; heds &nbsp; es &nbsp; endes &nbsp; erendes &nbsp; enes &nbsp; ernes &nbsp; eres &nbsp; ens &nbsp; hedens &nbsp; erens &nbsp; ers &nbsp; ets &nbsp; erets &nbsp; et &nbsp; eret_**

delete

(_b_) **_s_**

delete if preceded by a valid **_s_**\-ending

(Note that only the suffix needs to be in _R1_, the letter of the valid **_s_**\-ending is not required to be.)

Step 2:

Search for one of the following suffixes in _R1_, and if found delete the last letter.

**_gd &nbsp; dt &nbsp; gt &nbsp; kt_**

(For example, _friskt_ → _frisk_)

Step 3:

If the word ends **_igst_**, remove the final **_st_**.

Search for the longest among the following suffixes in _R1_, and perform the action indicated.

(_a_) **_ig &nbsp; lig &nbsp; elig &nbsp; els_**

delete, and then repeat step 2

(_b_) **_løst_**

replace with **_løs_**

Step 4: undouble

If the word ends with double consonant in _R1_, remove one of the consonants.

(For example, _bestemmelse_ → _bestemmels_ (step 1) → _bestemm_ (step 3_a_) → _bestem_ in this step.)
